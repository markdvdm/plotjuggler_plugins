# common struct (types) schema definitions
# 
# These structs are basic C-structs w/ inheritance
# *NOTE:* To preserve the original use of simple structs
#         used in the busRegistry, the message member
#         data is generated as simple structs
#         (i.e. structs are generated by bus_object_schema
#         and this file). If they are defined in both files
#         they must MATCH.
#
# 
#
# Information on the set of available fields are as follows:
#
# - struct:                 (Required - key in struct dictionary)
#    name : NameOfStruct    (Required)
#    namespace: some_name   (Optional - defaults to elroy_common_msg)
#    inherit :              (Optional - iheritance dictionary) 
#      name : some_namespace::SomeName  (Required - name of parent class. 
#                                       Namespace can be ignored if the class namespace
#                                       is the same as the parent namespace) 
#    members :              (Required - list of member dictionaries)
#      - name : MemberName  (Required - member name)
#        type : None        (Required - Supported types: 
#                                       fix-width integeres, float,
#                                       double, enums (per enumerates_schema),
#                                       or stuct (per this file). 
#                                       Arrays support, i.ee: `type : uint8_t[10]` )
#        default : None      (Optional - default initalized value)
#
#    # metadata is calculated and added by elroy_common_msg_generator.py.
#    # it is included here for the curious typer 
#    metadata :
#      members :            (data member info)
#        - name : None      (name)
#          array_len : X    (int(X) > 0)
#          type : None      (type)
#          default : None   (initialization)
#          is_struct : None (True/False if this data member is a struct)
#      file :
#        name : None        (name of file, no extension)
#        path : None        (file's path, name included)
#        header :           (header info, no source file)
#          extension: ".h"  
#          include_guard:   (header file include guard)
#          includes :       (list of header include files: parent classes, enums, etc)
#            - None
#            - None
